## What is this?

This is a simple binds library written in JavaScript I wrote in literally less than half an hour so bare with me, if needs lots of refactoring but it works, and it works decently well.

I'll do refactoring and all that when I'm bothered (never)

## What can't it do?

 - Vi like bindings
   - yy = pressing y twice etc
 - Work on only key down and not up
   - Haven't been bothered
